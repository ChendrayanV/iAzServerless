Please close this incident.\n\n2016-12-13 10:42:25 - David Loo (Additional comments)\nHi Joe,\nI've checked in network logs and you were timed out from the VPN at 9:25AM, 10:42AM and 2:28PM. These three times coincide with entries in the exchange server logs showing you lost connection at those same times. The VPN policy is to time out a connection if it hasn't been active in 30 minutes. Please ensure the next time you lose connectivity you are still connected to the VPN.\n\nI'm going to update this incident to resolved. Please let me know if you need any more assistance.\n\n2016-12-13 07:53:01 - Joe Employee (Additional comments)\nHi David,\nThank you!

Were there any other times you can recall you had issues connecting to the email?\n\n2016-12-12 16:56:57 - Beth Anglin (Additional comments)\nHi Joe, \nAs per discussion on call, Workaround has been provided and it has worked for you.

I'm going to assign this issue to the network team for further investigation.\n\n2016-12-12 12:43:50 - Joe Employee (Additional comments)\nHi Beth,\nYes, I'm connected to the VPN, although I've had to reconnect to it a couple of times.
